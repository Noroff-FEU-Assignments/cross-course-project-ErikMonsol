    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    
    <p id="web-security-answer">My advise is to secure his/her website is using a secore password is first important, the second step should be installing or getting a SSL certificate. What is an SSL Certificate? 
        That is SSL certificate encrypts website data and verifies identity for secure user connections.
    People can use Web Application Firewall or commonly called WAF to help stop cross site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection
The most important of all thing is to have multiple server bakcups so if you get hacked you can shut down server and start up the other one without worry of saves not saved. </p>
